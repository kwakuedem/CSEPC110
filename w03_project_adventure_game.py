# Features that exceed requirements:
# 1. Hidden choice in "LOOK AROUND" leads to discovering a key.
# 2. More than two choices in some scenarios (e.g., library and basement).
# 3. Multiple endings (winning, neutral, losing) provide diverse outcomes.
# 4. Input flexibility with case-insensitive handling using strip() and upper().
